# Semi Lexical Languages
This repository contains code for testing of Semi-Lexical Languages- a formal basis with imperfect tokens presented by the real world in an interpretable way. We combine the generalization capability of deep learning algorithms along with the interpretability of deduction systems. This repository mainly contains files for testing of integrated setup tested for dealing with two different scenarios as highlighted by the two directories. All the codes have been written in Python 3.6 and above.
