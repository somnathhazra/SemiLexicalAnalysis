This folder contains all the sub-directories containing the test images.
The detection results and explanations (along with counterfactual explanations) are generated inside this directory.
Detection results are generated in a common sub-directory named modified.
An intermediate sub-directory named actual is created when the algorithm runs. It is deleted just before the algorithm stops.
